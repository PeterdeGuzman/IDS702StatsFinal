# Selecting Variables

Need to include the outcome variable, which is an ordinal variable Q29. Main predictor variable is Q271 "How important is being \[RACIAL GROUP\] to your identity?"

```{r}

# Analysis of Missing Data

```{r}
# Check the number of missing values for each variable
missing_summary <- colSums(is.na(dataset_clean))
missing_summary

# Finding proportion of Missing Data
missing_proportion <- colSums(is.na(dataset_clean)) / nrow(dataset_clean)
missing_proportion

# Finding total missing data proportion
overall_missing <- sum(is.na(dataset_clean)) / (nrow(dataset_clean) * ncol(dataset_clean))
overall_missing
```

There is overall 8.3% missing values across all cells in this dataset. This is largely driven by two variables:

-   Q628: (IF S7=2 or 3 & Q627=1\] Did you experience that discrimination here in the United States, or in your home country?)

-   and Q629R1: In your opinion, were you unfairly treated because of your (Racial background or ethnicity)

For Q628, there are 15,709 (89.53%) missing values. For Q629R1 there are 9,180 (52.32%) missing values. We may need to consider not including these variables, because they may reduce our usable sample size.

### Interpretation

1.  Model Fit and Comparison:

-   We have two models: a simpler Model 1 (Q29 \~ Q271) and a more complex Model 2 with interactions (Q29 \~ Q271 \* S2_RACE_PRIME)
-   Model 2 has a better fit based on:
    -   Lower AIC (44585 vs 44784)
    -   Higher log-likelihood (-22250 vs -22385)

2.  Proportional Odds Assumption:

-   The nominal test for Model 2 shows significant violations (p \< 2.2e-16)
-   This suggests the effect of racial identity importance varies across different levels of political interest
-   While this violation is concerning, it's common in large samples and the model can still provide useful insights

3.  Multicollinearity:

-   The VIF values show:
    -   Very high multicollinearity for Q271 (466.39)
    -   Moderate for S2_RACE_PRIME (32.76)
    -   High for interactions (9870.36)
-   This high multicollinearity is partly due to the interaction terms and categorical variables

4.  Residuals and Model Diagnostics:

-   The residuals plot shows:
    -   A relatively flat line around zero
    -   Some systematic patterns in the residuals
    -   Suggests adequate but not perfect fit

5.  Influential Points:

-   883 influential observations identified
-   Cook's distance plot shows multiple observations above the threshold
-   Given the large sample size (17,545), this number of influential points is not extremely concerning

6.  Key Findings from Model 2:

-   Main effect of racial identity importance is significant (Q271.L: p=2.32e-06)
-   Most racial/ethnic groups show significantly different baseline levels of political interest compared to Whites
-   Several significant interaction effects, notably:
    -   Black/African Americans show different patterns than other groups
    -   Hispanic/Latino and Asian American groups have some distinct patterns
    -   Pacific Islanders show strong differences in how racial identity relates to political interest

7.  Predicted Relationships (from plot):

-   Generally positive relationship between racial identity importance and political interest
-   Different racial/ethnic groups show varying patterns:
    -   White and Arab/Middle Eastern/North African groups show strongest positive relationship
    -   Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander groups show more variable patterns
    -   Other groups show moderate positive relationships

## Model 1.2: Improved Ordinal Model

Key improvements:

Reduced multicollinearity through simplified predictors Added control variables Included mixed effects to account for clustering Added cross-validation for model validation Provides multiple diagnostic approaches

### Interpretation

1.  Model Improvement:

-   The simplified model (m3) shows better stability than the original model
-   Adding controls (m4) significantly improved the model fit:
    -   AIC decreased from 44622 to 42620
    -   Log-likelihood improved from -22299 to -21281

2.  Major Findings: From Model 4 (with controls):

<!-- -->

a)  Racial Identity Effects:

-   Base racial identity importance (Q271_simple) is not significant (p=0.449)
-   All racial groups show significantly different baseline political interest compared to Whites
-   Significant interaction effects:
    -   Black respondents: strongest positive interaction (β=0.170, p\<0.001)
    -   Asian respondents: moderate positive interaction (β=0.122, p\<0.001)
    -   Hispanic respondents: slight positive interaction (β=0.081, p\<0.05)

b)  Important Control Variables:

-   Education shows strong positive effects
    -   Post-graduate degree has strongest effect (β=1.286, p\<0.001)
-   Age effects are significant for older groups
    -   70+ shows highest interest (β=0.472, p\<0.001)
-   Gender differences are substantial
    -   Women show lower interest (β=-0.530, p\<0.001)
-   Party affiliation matters
    -   Independents (β=-0.568) and Other party (β=-1.549) show less interest

3.  Diagnostic Issues:

<!-- -->

a)  Multicollinearity:

-   Still present but improved from original model:
    -   VIF for race_major: 3.05
    -   VIF for interactions: 3.34
-   While high, these are more manageable than the original model

b)  Residuals:

-   Show some pattern in residual plot
-   Suggests possible non-linear relationships not captured

c)  Influential Points:

-   979 influential observations (5.6% of sample)
-   While high, this is better than the original model

4.  Model Predictions (from plot):

-   Shows clear racial/ethnic differences in relationship between identity importance and political interest
-   Black respondents show steepest positive slope
-   White respondents show relatively flat but positive relationship
-   Other groups show moderate positive relationships

5.  Violations and Concerns:

-   Model convergence warning in m3
-   Some remaining non-linearity in residuals
-   **Proportional odds assumption is violated (significant nominal test)**

From Model 3 (simplified model):

```         
Tests of nominal effects
formula: Q29 ~ Q271_simple * race_major
                       Df logLik   AIC   LRT  Pr(>Chi)    
<none>                    -22299 44623                    
Q271_simple                                               
race_major              8 -22248 44535 103.7 < 2.2e-16 ***
Q271_simple:race_major 10 -22246 44536 106.9 < 2.2e-16 ***
```

The test results show: 1. The race_major variable has a significant LRT (Likelihood Ratio Test) statistic (103.7) with p \< 2.2e-16 2. The interaction term Q271_simple:race_major also has a significant LRT (106.9) with p \< 2.2e-16

Interpretation: - Yes, the proportional-odds assumption is violated. Both the main effect of race and its interaction with racial identity importance show highly significant p-values (\< 2.2e-16) - This means that the effect of the predictors is not constant across the different thresholds of political interest - In other words, the relationship between racial identity importance and political interest varies not just across racial groups, but also across different levels of political interest

Implications: 1. The current model might not fully capture the complexity of the relationships 2. Consider alternative approaches such as: - Using partial proportional odds models - Fitting separate models for different levels of political interest - Using multinomial logistic regression instead of ordinal

### Interpretation

1.  Model Fit:

-   Multinomial model with controls (AIC = 42457.29) shows better fit than without controls (AIC = 44548.09)
-   Original ordinal model with controls had AIC = 42620, so the multinomial model performs slightly better
-   McFadden's R-squared improved from 0.009 (basic) to 0.058 (with controls), indicating better fit with controls but still relatively low explanatory power

2.  Classification Performance:

-   Overall accuracy is 43.39%
-   The confusion matrix shows the model is predicting mostly "Somewhat interested" category
-   This suggests poor discrimination between categories, as it's biased toward the most common outcome

3.  Key Findings from Multinomial Model:

<!-- -->

a)  Racial Identity Effects (from model with controls):

-   Base effect of racial identity importance (Q271_simple) is not significant for most categories
-   Significant interactions with race, particularly:
    -   Black respondents show strongest positive interaction (β=0.291, p\<0.001)
    -   Asian respondents show moderate interaction (β=0.208, p\<0.001)
    -   Hispanic respondents show weaker interaction (β=0.121, p\<0.05)

b)  Control Variables:

-   Education shows strong positive effects
    -   Post-graduate degree has strongest effect (β=2.338 for "Very interested")
-   Gender differences are substantial
    -   Women less likely to be "Very interested" (β=-0.948)
-   Age effects increase with age
    -   70+ shows highest interest (β=0.842 for "Very interested")

4.  Visualization Insights:

<!-- -->

a)  Marginal Effects Plot shows:

-   Different patterns across racial groups
-   Black respondents show steepest increase in political interest with racial identity importance
-   White respondents show relatively flat relationship
-   Asian and Hispanic respondents show moderate positive relationships

b)  Predicted Probabilities Plot reveals:

-   Higher probability of being "Somewhat interested" across all groups
-   Decreasing probability of being "Not at all interested" as racial identity importance increases
-   Increasing probability of being "Very interested" for most racial groups as racial identity importance increases

5.  Comparison with Ordinal Model:

Advantages of Multinomial Model: - No proportional odds assumption - More flexible in modeling category-specific effects - Slightly better model fit (lower AIC)

Disadvantages: - More complex interpretation - Less parsimonious (more parameters) - Poor classification performance - Loss of ordinal information

Recommendations: 1. Consider using a partial proportional odds model that relaxes the proportional odds assumption only for variables that violate it 2. Add interaction terms between control variables 3. Consider collapsing some categories if theoretically justified 4. Use robust standard errors to account for potential heteroskedasticity

### Interpretation

1.  Model Performance:

-   PPO model (AIC = 35,531.52) shows substantial improvement over:
    -   Original ordinal model (AIC = 42,620)
    -   Multinomial model (AIC = 42,457)
    -   Interaction model (AIC = 42,635)
-   Cross-validation accuracy (47.87%) is better than multinomial model (43.39%)

2.  Key Findings from PPO Model:

Most Important Predictors (by Z-score): 1. Gender (Woman): β = 0.528, z = 17.74 2. Party (Other): β = 1.325, z = 16.25 3. Party (Independent): β = 0.549, z = 12.58 4. Race (Asian): β = 1.304, z = 10.10 5. Age (70+): β = -0.471, z = 8.07

3.  Racial Identity Effects:

-   Base effect of racial identity importance (Q271_simple) is not significant
-   Significant interactions with race:
    -   Black: strongest negative interaction (β = -0.165, p \< 0.001)
    -   Asian: moderate negative interaction (β = -0.149, p \< 0.001)
    -   Hispanic: weaker negative interaction (β = -0.087, p \< 0.05)
    -   Other: strong negative interaction (β = -0.188, p \< 0.001)

4.  Control Variable Effects:

-   Education shows strong negative effects:
    -   Post-graduate: β = -1.257
    -   Bachelor's: β = -1.033
-   Age effects are significant:
    -   Older age groups show decreasing interest
-   Party affiliation matters:
    -   Other party: β = 1.325
    -   Independent: β = 0.549

5.  Visualization Insights: The predicted probabilities plot shows:

-   Different patterns across racial groups
-   White respondents: most stable relationship
-   Black respondents: stronger relationship between identity importance and interest
-   Asian respondents: highest probability of medium interest
-   Hispanic and Other: similar patterns to Black respondents but weaker

Comparison with Previous Models:

1.  Advantages of PPO Model:

-   Better model fit (lower AIC)
-   More nuanced capture of racial differences
-   Better handling of ordinal nature while allowing non-proportional effects
-   Higher prediction accuracy

2.  Disadvantages:

-   More complex interpretation
-   Still moderate prediction accuracy (47.87%)

Key Differences: 1. More precise estimates of racial effects 2. Better capture of education and age effects 3. More accurate representation of interaction effects 4. Better overall model fit

Recommendations: 1. **Use the PPO model as the primary model for inference** 2. Consider the intersectionality of race and education 3. Further investigate the role of age and party affiliation 4. Use predicted probabilities for interpretation
