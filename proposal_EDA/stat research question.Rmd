**Research question 2:** Controlling for other demographic variables such as age and gender,How do experiences with racism influence the importance respondents place on policy issues related to racial and ethnic discrimination? - Outcome variable (include the name/description and type of variable): Stopping discrimination against racial/ethnic minorities (Q1R5) â€” a binary variable indicating whether respondents view it as an important issue.

**Variable Type:** Binary.

**Interaction Term Idea:** Include an interaction term between race/ethnicity (S2RACER) and experiences with racism to see if the influence of racism experiences differs across racial/ethnic groups.

**Exploratory Plots:**

```{r}
data$Q1R5_cleaned <- as.numeric(sub("^\\((\\d+)\\).*", "\\1", data$Q1R5))

data$Q1R5_cleaned <- factor(data$Q1R5_cleaned, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Not Important", "Important"))

# Check the cleaned variable
table(data$Q1R5_cleaned)

# Plot the distribution of Q1R5
ggplot(data, aes(x = Q1R5_cleaned)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Importance of Stopping Discrimination Against Racial/Ethnic Minorities",
       x = "Importance Level",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

```

```{r}
data$MAIN_ETH_QUOTA_numeric <- as.numeric(sub("^\\((\\d+)\\).*", "\\1", data$MAIN_ETH_QUOTA))
data$Race_Ethnicity <- factor(data$MAIN_ETH_QUOTA_numeric,
                              levels = 1:7,
                              labels = c("White", "Latino", "Black", "AAPI", "ANAI", "MENA", "NH"))
